				<p>In 1958, English pictorial photographer Henry Peach 	Robinson created the world’s first photomontage by 	combining five different negatives to make one complete 	print of a young girl on her deathbed. “Fading 	Away”—Robinson’s first and most famous composite 	photo—depicts a young girl dying of consumption and was 	controversial when it was exhibited, with many believing it was not a suitable subject for photography.</p>

		<p>On the night of Aug,8 1975 a line of people frantically pilled sandbags atop Hanem Province's Banqiao Dan while being battered by the worst storm ever recorded in the region. They were in a race with the rapidly rising Ru River to save the dam and the millions of people that lay sleeping downstream. It was a race there were about to lose.</p>
		<p>Just after 1:00am, the sky cleared and stars emerged from behind the storm clouds. There was an eerie calm as someone yelled, <q> The water level is going down! The flood is retreating!</q></p>
		<p>There was little chance to enjoy the calm. One survivor recalled that a few seconds later it <q>sounded like the sky was collapsing and the earth was cracking</q> The equivalent of 280,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools burst through the crumbling dam, taking with it entire towns as many as 171,000 lives</p>
